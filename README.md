# Monte-Carlo-simulation-for-nuclear-decay-of-Cesium-137
This code was used to approach an activity of undergrad physics lab, relted to the decay og Cs137 as gamma rays, intending to simulate whether  it would occur compton effect or photoelectric effect with certain probability and taking into consideration de losses due to the measuring apparatus.
